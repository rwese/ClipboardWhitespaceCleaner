# ClipboardWhitespaceCleaner
Remove unnecessary whitespaces

Everyone knows that copying strings from browsers or other applications will contain whitespaces and other characters. Ever tried to copy a password from an email? (yeah, you really shouldn't send passwords via email)

## Requirements
* Python 3
  * pyperclip

I only tested this on **WINDOWS**, since this is where I need it the most.

## Usage
The Script will run indefinitely in the background.

'''
python ClipboardMonitory.py
'''

## Function
Remove leading and trailing whitespaces.

* Don't remove inside sublimetext

## Todo

* Add configuration for exclusions and browsers
